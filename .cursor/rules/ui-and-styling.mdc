- Utilize Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes for styling components.
- Follow shadcn/ui, magic ui component patterns and best practices.
- When creating new components, reference existing components in `src/components/ui`.
- Ensure UI is responsive, accessible and supports both light and dark modes.
- Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) for responsive designs.
- Components should be modular, reusable, and have appropriate TypeScript interfaces/types.
- For complex components that require state, consider extracting logic to custom hooks.
- Remember that this is a cloud management platform UI, so prioritize clarity and usability for technical users.
